# This repo is a python project to automate switching on and off of the proxy
## This is using pyautogui
This repository is very specific and only works for my laptop you can download the test.exe file from dist/
although it may depend on your laptop .
I am working on second version

test2 is a little better

Turning on and off proxy is just one click away 
run the test2.exe
